Awesomesauce Evolutionary biologists, science lover and beginning programmer.
- I have worked on many projects over the years, ranging from Ecological surveys to consultation work

- Recently I have taken up a greater interest in programming, particularly in scientific analysis, simulation and gaming.

- Currently I am regularly using C# , C++ and Python as programming languages, I would however like to extend some languages commonly found on the web.

    var1 = "Hello World!" 
    print(var1)
    print(len(var1))
